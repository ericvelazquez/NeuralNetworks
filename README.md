# NeuralNetworks

Some of the Neural Networks project I implemented for my classes at UCCS.

- Cifar10_classifier
- Voting system for the cifar10 classifier which uses 2 archictures diesgned and implemented by myself and 3 architectures designed in the "Striving for Simplicity: The All Convolutional Net" paper and implemented in my own way.
